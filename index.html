        <h1>Kate Huffstutler</h1>
        <h2>college freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>My family is from Akron, Ohio, but I moved down south for the schoolyear to attend Bob Jones University. I am studying English with a concentration in literature. I work for the campus library and as a consultant at the writing center.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy hanging out with my friends, and I am active in my local church: Mount Calvary Baptist Church of Greenville, SC.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy hiking, watching the sunset, cooking, and reading great books.
